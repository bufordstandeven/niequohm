There's just something about death note. it's OST, Plot structure, themes and characters that I just feel like sharing with people. My first instinct was, (after watching the first episode online with my grandma) to buy her the box set which we watched together start to finish. Then I watched it with my mum. Did anyone else feel the need to share this experience with their mother? © 2012-2019 x-minus.me - Бepитe мyзыки cтoлькo, cкoлькo xoтите! х-minus-me@yandex.com. 
i recently watched akatsuki no yona,unlike soundtracks i hear from other anime,this show focus on the eastern kind of ost.So i'm wondering if there are any good anime with such soundtracks focusing on the eastern kind of instruments. i would also like to know more anime with good soundtrack so suggest some anime and i will watch Действие всей серии «Наруто» разворачивается в вымышленном мире, социально-политической структурой напоминающем феодальную Японию. https://soundcloud.com/seul-oc-an/seul-ocean-signal?in=seul-oc-an/sets/a-louest-ep#t=1:28 I tried to listen to various playlists on Youtube to find the song, but couldn't find the one that this song reminds me of. I'm almost positive it's a Death note theme/OST.

Its OST is on a whole other level when compared to DTB's. So, on the topic of soundtracks, I was just wondering what other anime have great soundtracks.
